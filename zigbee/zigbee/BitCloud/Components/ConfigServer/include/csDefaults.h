  \brief
  Configuration Server parameters default values.
  The contents of this file must not be changed by a user. Any default value can be redefined
  in the application \c configuration.h file.

  Most of the parameters descriptions include the following standard remarks:

  \li <b>Value range</b> notes describe possible values that can be taken by a parameter;
  \li <b>C-type</b> stands for the type in code that can be used to hold a value of a parameter;
  \li <b>Can be set</b> indicates when a parameter can be changed: <i>at compile time only</i>, <i>at any time before network start</i>, or <i>at any time</i>;
  \li if a parameter is stored in EEPROM memory so that its value does not change after hardware reset, while
  other parameters restore their default values, then it is marked as <b>Persistent</b>; note that only
  run-time parameters can be persistent.

//! \brief The maximum depth of a network
/*!
The parameter determines the maximum depth of a network tree formed by
child-parent relationships between nodes.

While joining the network the node receives beacon responses from potential
parents containing their actual network depth and declines those which show values not
less than the maximum network depth on the  joining device. A potential parent will also reject a
beacon from the joining device and will not sent a response if the joining device shows the network
depth greater than it is allowed on the potential parent. This logic is enabled if the parameter value
is not greater  than 15. If its value is greater than 15, then device does not perform any checkings of
the network depth, neither when joining a network nor when accepting other nodes as children.
This allows forming long chains of devices across considerable distances.

The stack also uses the parameter to calculate several timeouts. Besides, the parameter determines the maximum radius
of a data packet, that is, the maximum number of hops that a packet may travel, which is calculated by
the following formula:

<i>maximum radius = 2 * MIN(2 * maxNetworkDepth, 255)</i> \n

These uses of the parameter do not change if its value is greater than 15. Therefore to enable
transmitting data over long chains of devices, the parameter should be set to a real desired network depth,
rather than to an accidental value over 15.

The parameter should be the same on all devices in the network.

On an end device this parameter determines the duration of a sleep period. Falling asleep is

If the parameter's value is 0, then after the node falls asleep it can only be awakened by a

On a router or the coordinator, the parameter is used in two ways:

frames from the child end device for

2) To determine whether to store or drop a message addressed to a child end device.  The parent

request has been received. If the time till end device wake up is greater than CS_MAC_TRANSACTION_TIME

/** \brief The maximum route cost between two nodes for direct delivery

A data frame is routed directly to the neighbor only if the route cost, read 
from the neighbor table, is less than the value of the parameter. If the route
cost is greater than the value of the parameter, route discovery will be
initiated to find an indirect route to the nighbor.

<b>Value range:</b> 0 - 8 \n
0 - ignore information in the neighbor table (always start route discovery) \n
8 - always send data directly to a neighbor

<b>C-type:</b> NwkLinkCost_t (typedef for uint8_t) \n
<b>Can be set:</b> at any time before network start \n
<b>Persistent:</b> No
